-- this is a common technique to use an "in" statement to filter by a subquery
-- the subquery must return a single column or it wont work
-- you could totally rewrite this to join 
select * from orders where customer_id in ( select id from customers where customer_name like 'A%');

-- subquery - by using subquery in the from clause it creates a small table in memory from the query
-- then you can join to the table as if it were a real table
select *

-- ================== LEFT JOIN =======================

select * from customers where id = 125;
select * from orders where customer_id = 125;

-- this is the left join syntax for 2 tables
SELECT  c.id as customer_id,  c.customer_name, o.id as order_id, o.status

SELECT  c.id as customer_id,  c.customer_name, o.id as order_id, o.status

SELECT  c.id as customer_id,  c.customer_name, o.id as order_id, o.status

INNER JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
order by c.id;


-- ===================== SELF JOIN =====================

select * from customers;
select * from employees;

-- when doing a self join you use the same table in the from 2 times
-- self referencing table 
select e.id, e.lastname, e.firstname, e.job_title, m.id as manager_id, m.lastname as manager_lastname, m.firstname as manager_firstname, m.job_title
from employees e, employees m
where e.reports_to = m.id;

-- ======================= UNION =========================
-- does get used from time to time
-- main use is in reports or very complex queryies 
-- union does not include duplicates - meaning after mering the result sets there are no duplicates
-- union all inludes duplicates

select * from customers where customer_name like 'A%'
union
select * from customers where customer_name like 'A%';

select phone from customers where customer_name like 'A%'
